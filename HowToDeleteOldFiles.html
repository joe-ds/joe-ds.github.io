    <h2 id="the-two-ways">The Two Ways</h2>
    <p>So, likely as not, you want to do this on either Linux or Windows. But
    in case you want to do it on both (and it's fun to!) we'll look at
    both.</p>

    <h2 id="bash">Bash</h2>
    <p>Writing a bash script (or any shell script) is as easy as writing the
    commands you want to run line by line as if you are running them line
    by line! There's some extra stuff you <em>can</em> optionally do
    to get in some extra flexibility too!</p>
    <p>There are two ways to do this: let's look at the easy way by chaining
    commands.</p>

    <h3 id="chaining-commands">Chaining Commands</h3>
    <p>The easiest way to do things is to run different commands line-by-line.
    If you want to send the output of one command to another, you use the
    pipe <kbd>|</kbd>.</p>
    <pre>
    <code>cd /home/eric/wordlist/
    cat list_of_usernames.txt | grep 'jones'</code></pre>

    <p>Now for the code above, we are trying to go to a folder, and get all
    the usernames with 'jones' as part of the username. But there are some
    issues here. For one, if we know the username file is always in that
    folder, we can just get it out of there straightaway.</p>

    <pre>
    <code>cat /home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt | grep 'jones'</code></pre>

    <p>
    Now, this here is what is nicknamed 'cat abuse'. We don't really need to
    <kbd>cat</kbd> out the file.</p>
    <pre>
    <samp>user@mycomputer $ grep
    Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERNS [FILE]...
    Try 'grep --help' for more information.</samp></pre>

    <p>So we see we can actually pass the file straight to <kbd>grep</kbd>.</p>

    <pre>
    <code>grep 'jones' /home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt</code></pre>

    <p>But this is kind of hard to edit. You'd have to go into the line to
    change what you are looking for every time. And if you are referencing
    it multiple times, it is really annoying. For example, what if we want to
    print out what we are searching for every time like so?</p>

    <pre>
    <code>cat 'Searching for jones in /home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt'
    grep 'jones' /home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt</code></pre>
    
    <p>Try and edit that script to load a different list and search for a different
    name. (It doesn't have to exist!)</p>

    <textarea rows="2" cols="79">cat 'Searching for jones in /home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt'
grep 'jones' /home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt</textarea>

    <p>Really annoying, right? Good news is that we have a solution: variables!
    You can assign variables very easily: <kbd>variable_name=value</kbd>.
    And you can use it with <kbd>$variable_name</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Just note one thing: you can only do that with stuff in double quotes,
    not single quotes. A good rule of thumb when writing bash scripts is
    to use double-quotes if you really want to include something like a
    variable, and single-quotes otherwise. Also, don't put spaces on either
    side of the equal sign!</p>

    <p>Let's rewrite this to use variables:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>searching_for='jones'
    file='/home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt'
    cat "Searching for $jones in $searching_for"
    grep $searching_for $file</code></pre>

    <p>Much better! But it's still not perfect. Do you really want to edit the
    script file every single time? That's so slow. You'd be better off
    just typing the command every time.</p>

    <p>A bash function is written like this:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>function_name () {
        echo "I was called with $1"
    }</code></pre>

    <pre>
    <samp>user@mycomputer $ function_name "cheep-cheep"
    "I was called with cheep-cheep"</samp></pre>
    
    <p>You put in all the code you want to run inside the curly braces. And
    you can access anything passed to your function with <kbd>$1</kbd>,
    <kbd>$2</kbd>, <kbd>$3</kbd>, etc. There's also <kbd>$#</kbd>, which
    is how many arguments (that's what those are called) were passed to
    the function.</p>

    <p>So let's put this together. We always want to give our function a
    pattern, but we may not always want to give it a file: we could have
    a default one, but if we are given one, we can use the one we are
    given.</p>

    <pre>
    <code>function pattern_search () {
        file='/home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt'
        if [ "$#" -eq 2 ]
            then
                file=$2
        fi

        echo "Searching for $1 in $file"
        grep "$1" "$file"
    }</code></pre>

    <p>So, what's going on here? We first check if we've got two arguments.
    If we do, then we replace <kbd>file</kbd> with the second argument.
    In the end, we run the command.</p>

    <p>Two things: what is that <kbd>if</kbd> construct? Even if you are used
    to them in other languages, the syntax can be a bit weirder in bash. I'd
    recommend reading
    <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html">this</a>
    and
    <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_02.html">this</a>
    for an explanation.</p>

    <p>The other thing to note is that <em>now</em> when running
    our <kbd>grep</kbd> command we are surrounding the arguments with quotes. Read
    more about that <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/SC2086">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Let's put it all together. We can run this with <kbd>bash file.bash</kbd>,
    but if we add a line to the top of our file, we can run it with just `./file.bash`
    and Linux will know what to do.</p>
    
    <pre>
    <code>#!/bin/bash
    function pattern_search () {
        file='/home/eric/wordlist/list_of_usernames.txt'
        if [ "$#" -eq 2 ]
            then
                file=$2
        fi

        echo "Searching for $1 in $file"
        grep "$1" "$file"
    }</code></pre>

    <p>Note that if you want this function to be available all the time, you can
        just put the function into your <kbd>.bashrc</kbd> file.</p>

    <p>Note that if you want to check your code, a useful site is
        <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/">ShellCheck</a>.</p>

    <p>However, while you can chain together commands and maybe find something
        useful, there is another easier way, if you know the right command.</p>

    <h3 id="find"><kbd>find</kbd></h3>
    <p>The <kbd>find</kbd> command is a useful command to find files with. You
    have to give it a starting place, and some criteria.</p>

    <pre>
    <samp>user@mycomputer $ find /home/kurt/ -iname 'username'</samp></pre>

    <p>All the flags and arguments to <kbd>find</kbd> are optional. By default it starts
    searching from the present directory. Note that you can also give it a
    <kbd>maxdepth</kbd> argument to determine how deep into folders it goes.
    Use <kbd>find --help</kbd> to read up on all its many options.</p>

    <p>What makes <kbd>find</kbd> very useful for our purposes is that it has
    two arguments that are very handy. One is <kbd>-mtime</kbd>. You can
    give this argument a number with a + or - in front of it. So
    <kbd>-mtime +30</kbd> will search for files over 30 days old. I'm sure
    you can see why this is very handy.</p>

    <p>The other, and be careful with this one, is <kbd>-exec</kbd>. This
    will run a shell command for every file found. <strong>Do not use
    <kbd>rm</kbd> when playing with this! Use <kbd>ls</kbd> instead to see
    what files would be deleted by your command.</strong> Even when you use
    <kbd>rm</kbd> you can pass in the <kbd>-i</kbd> flag to have confirmation
    before each file is deleted.</p>

    <p>To use this argument, simply write the command you want to run after it,
    with <kbd>{}</kbd> going where you want the filename to go, and end the
    command with <kbd>\;</kbd> to both end the command and make sure it's not
    ending the <kbd>find</kbd> command. For example,</p>

    <pre>
    <samp>user@mycomputer $ find -mtime -30 -type f -exec wc -l {} \;</samp></pre>

    <p>This will look for all files (that's the <kbd>-type f</kbd> is doing) that
    are less than 30 days old and give us the number of lines in them using
    <kbd>wc</kbd>.</p>

    <p>So combine this with your knowledge of shell scripting and writing functions
    above, and you have all you need to write the script you want.</p>

    <h2 id="powershell">PowerShell</h2>
    <p>Alright, what about Windows? PowerShell is my go-to way on Windows. It works
    in many of the same ways as bash. You can pipe the output of one command to the
    next with the <kbd>|</kbd> (pipe) operator.</p>

    <p>We'll get to how to save and run PowerShell scripts in a little bit. One
    thing we have to note is there is no exact match for the <kbd>find</kbd>
    command. But on the other hand the syntax is so much clearer (in my
    opinion!)</p>

    <p>So let's look at the pieces:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><kbd>Get-ChildItem</kbd>: This is equivalent to Linux's
        <kbd>ls</kbd>. You can pass it the <kbd>-File</kbd> argument to make
        sure that only files are listed.</li>
        <li><kbd>Where-Object</kbd>: This lets us filter things. You can look into
        it (and I recommend it if you get into PowerShell scripting [which I also
        really recommend]). But all we need is
        <kbd>Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-15)}</kbd>.<br/>
        Briefly, <kbd>$_</kbd> is a bit like <kbd>{}</kbd> in the
        <kbd>find -exec</kbd> command. It refers to each item. We then get the 
        <kbd>LastWriteTime</kbd> and compare it to today minus 15 days.</li>
        <li><kbd>Remove-Item</kbd>: Our <kbd>rm</kbd>. Be just as careful. If you
        omit this at the end, you can just see the output. You can also, and this
        is really useful, use the <kbd>-WhatIf</kbd> flag to see what would happen
        without actually deleting anything.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pipe these commands together, and you have everything you need.</p>

    <p>Using this, in a good and proper way, is a bit more involved. What I'd
    recommend is turning your script into a module. It's not hard.</p>

    <h3 id="module">Getting Setup With Your First Module</h3>
    <p>Let's first make sure that PowerShell is setup to run our scripts. Run
    the following to change the execution policy.</p>

    <pre><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser</code></pre>

    <p>Read up on
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4">execution policies</a>,
    but the gist is that we are setting it so that remote scripts have to be
    signed, but we can run any of our local scripts without signing them.</p>

    <p>The next thing to do is to check the PowerShell folder (for the newer
    versions of PowerShell). If you don't have one in your Documents folder,
    make it. Then make sure there is a Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file
    in it. Also make sure there is a powershell.config.json file too, with the
    value <kbd>{"Microsoft.PowerShell:ExecutionPolicy":"RemoteSigned"}</kbd> in
    it.</p>

    <p>You can paste the following lines into PowerShell to check it's all there:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell"
    Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\powershell.config.json"
    Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1"
    (Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShell\powershell.config.json") -eq '{"Microsoft.PowerShell:ExecutionPolicy":"RemoteSigned"}'</code></pre>

    <p>Now you're ready to make your first module. In the Modules directory in the
    PowerShell directory, make a folder. Name it whatever you want your module
    to be called. In that folder, make a .psm1 file called the same name as your
    folder. That file is your module file.</p>

    <pre>
    <code>function My-Module {
        put your code in here
    }

    Export-ModuleMember -Function My-Module</code></pre>

    <p>Make sure that the name in the last line where the function is exported
    is the same as your function name. At the same time, this is a terrible name
    and PowerShell will complain at you. The right way to name a module is as
    Verb-Noun. The noun can be whatever you want — File, Stuff, etc. The verb,
    on the other hand, should come from a list of approved verbs. You can see it
    by running <kbd>Get-Verb</kbd> in a PowerShell window.</p>

    <p>When you are done, open up the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file and
    add your module: just add the line <kbd>Import-Module MyModule</kbd>. Make
    sure you use the folder name, and not your function name.</p>

    <p>If you've done everything right, you can open a new PowerShell window and
    punch in the name of your function and run it.</p>

    <p><em>P. S. PowerShell functions are just as powerful as bash functions,
    but learning to use them is left as an exercise for the reader. The
    documentation is pretty straightforward, so you'll be fine!</em></p>
